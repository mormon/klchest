key duplicator
  W _ W

chest has by default a bit smaller capacity than default:chest, 
the slots on the left are:
top - key
bottom - lock

currently keys are encoded by putting 2 new keys in both 
lock and key slot and punching the chest

locking and unlocking can be done with 2 methods:
- punch the chest while corresponding key is in top slot
- wielding correct key - use it on the chest (punch?)

key duplicator works by inserting a fresh key and punching the
duplicator with an encoded key
additionally punching empty duplicator displays key encoding
punching with anything else resets infotext
